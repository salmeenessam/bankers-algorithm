# Bankers Algorithm
This is the implementation of the bankers algorithm which is usually used to allocate finite resources to a set of tasks/processes/etc. This algorithm is usually used to avoid deadlocks occuring in Operating Systems.

In this implementation, the algorithm parameters are:
- The number of processes `n`
- The number of resource types `m`
- The quantity available of the resource type for each of `m`
- The allocated quantity of the resource type for each of `m`
- The required quantity of each resource each process of `n` needs
